                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                    <p>CookMark is a web application designed to help users save and share recipes, from friends' recommendations to beloved family favorites across generations.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top:6vh;">THE PROBLEM</p>
                    <p>Recipes are saved in all random places and often lost in bad handwriting, poor communication, or worn down recipe cards.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top:6vh;">THE GOAL</p>
                    <p>Generate a way to keep all recipes in one place and easy to share with others.</p>

                <h2>Understanding the User</h2>
                <p style="margin-top:6vh;">SUMMARY</p>
                <p>For my recipe-organizing app, I conducted a competitive audit to see what has already been done to organize and share recipes digitally. I wanted to do my research this way because I was mainly concerned about how other apps displayed recipes to the user.</p>
                <p>Going into this research, I assumed formats for these apps would be very similar in layout and color, but I was pleasantly surprised to find many different ways apps displayed the data and visual themes for “food”. I got to see what I felt worked and what I felt didn’t in terms of these elements. This gave me insight for when I decide on color and layout for my app.</p>

                    <p>During the sketch process, I wanted to get down as many ideas as possible in one instance, and then Frankenstein the best parts of those different iterations together. I started this process with the homepage of the web version of the app, and I found some useful components and icons I definitely wanted to include in my lo-fi mockups.</p>
                    <p>I want to say I started with a mobile first approach, but my paper wireframes for the website were what initially inspired me to start making mockups for the mobile version of the application.</p>

                <p>On the “Add New Recipe” page, I wanted to be accessible for people with very specific dietary restrictions. I added sections like “allergy Information” for users to add notes such as “gluten free” or “contains peanuts”.</p>

                    <h2>Low Fidelity Prototype</h2>
                    <p>Here I created the bare bones of the <span style="font-style:italic;">functional</span> mobile and web app to see how it would run through different sequences of the user flow. In these prototypes, you'll find many oversized buttons or wonky icons I later ironed out after plugging in actual content. Creating these lo-fi prototypes helped me fix those problem areas and create more breathable space in the final cut of the designs.</p>

                <h2>Mockups</h2>
                <p>The translation of the homepage was pretty straightforward from the lo-fi prototype. I was able to test out contrast for the call-to-action buttons and really make them pop. I also fixed minor adjustments like the logo clearing the iPhone hotbar (which should also clear other widgets on other devices).</p>
                <p>The “My Friends” page had some major improvements. I implemented a tabs function, where users can flip between seeing all of their friends and just their bookmarked friends. Users will want to bookmark their favorite users when they have consistently good recipes, especially grandma's.</p>

                <p>I also made sure to make the images of food part of the most prominent details on each page so that it would spark interest in the user. Usually seeing photography of food will help users make their decisions on what to cook.</p>
