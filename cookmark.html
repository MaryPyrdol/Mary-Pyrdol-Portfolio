                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                    <p>CookMark is a web application designed to help users save and share recipes, from friends' recommendations to beloved family favorites across generations.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top:6vh;">THE PROBLEM</p>
                    <p>Recipes are saved in all random places and often lost in bad handwriting, poor communication, or worn down recipe cards.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top:6vh;">THE GOAL</p>
                    <p>Generate a way to keep all recipes in one place and easy to share with others.</p>

                <h2>Understanding the User</h2>
                <p style="margin-top:6vh;">SUMMARY</p>
                <p>For my recipe-organizing app, I conducted a competitive audit to see what has already been done to organize and share recipes digitally. I wanted to do my research this way because I was mainly concerned about how other apps displayed recipes to the user.</p>
                <p>Going into this research, I assumed formats for these apps would be very similar in layout and color, but I was pleasantly surprised to find many different ways apps displayed the data and visual themes for “food”. I got to see what I felt worked and what I felt didn’t in terms of these elements. This gave me insight for when I decide on color and layout for my app.</p>
