                <h2>What is <span class="pi-link"><a href="https://psyche.asu.edu/get-involved/psyche-inspired/" target="_blank">Psyche Inspired</a></span>?</h2>
                <p>Pulling from the description on the <span class="pi-link"><a href="https://psyche.asu.edu/get-involved/psyche-inspired/" target="_blank">Psyche Inspired webpage</a></span>, "Psyche Inspired is a program that brings undergraduate students from any discipline or major together to share the excitement, innovation, and scientific and engineering content of NASA's Psyche mission with the public in new ways through artistic and creative works."</p>
                <p>From my time as a Psyche Intern (Copper Class), I would describe the experience as one of the best opportunities for me to create artwork for the sake of creativity. What I mean by that is, since all the instruction they gave us towards our four projects was to "be inspired", us interns were tasked with navigating the boundlessness of creating.. basically whatever we wanted (as long as it was inspired by the mission, of course).</p>
                <p>I saw this as an opportunity to explore different mediums within and outside of my comfort zone as an emerging graphic designer. At the time I was selected to participate in the program, I had just started my first semester of digital design courses at Boston University. I was beyond excited to weave what I was doing in the studio into my NASA projects, and even more excited to see where my inspirations would take me from there.</p>

                    <h2>Greetings from PSYCHE</h2>
                    <h3>Digital Postcard Design • Adobe Illustrator • Procreate</h3>
                    <p>When we leave home to explore a new or significant location far away, we often like to commemorate our journey or send a message home with a postcard. My project is a graphic design of a postcard that reads, “Greetings from PSYCHE,” and it is accompanied by a digital illustration of the asteroid and the spacecraft on its orbital mission. The backside features the quote, “JOURNEY TO A METAL WORLD”, along with an opaque illustration of the asteroid and some retro starburst decals. The concept behind the graphic style comes from the art movement Retro Futurism, a style originating from around the 1970s in depictions of 1950s America if it were heavily influenced by ambitious technologies of the future. Retro Futurism revolves around this idea of nostalgia within dreaming of what the world of tomorrow could be. Mostly inspired by Walt Disney's Tomorrowland concept, I wanted to carry Retro Futurism into my graphic language to express NASA's optimism and ambition for the Psyche mission while also being nostalgic of when space exploration was new to us.</p>
