                <p>As global warming and other planetary catastrophes are worsening, tension forms between the ecosystem and the future—<span style="font-style:italic;">when will Earth be healthy again? How do we get there faster?</span> When the media force-feeds us the doom of the biosphere on a global scale, it can be difficult for an individual to appreciate the sustainable progress we have made thus far. The Climate Clock, for example, is designed to instill fear, in that we are running out of time to turn things around. It is here where I observe how design influences our perception of the future; <span style="font-style:italic;">what role can design play instead to show our progress? How can design influence our perception of “doing enough”?</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-style:italic;">The Bottom of My Garden</span> is the concept for an app designed to ease this tension by focusing on you. This experience displays the sustainable progress of an individual through the metaphor of a garden. While Earth's ecosystem is vast and difficult to quantify, a garden is small and local, benefiting solely from its caretaker. Users create their own personal ecosystem, thriving on the tasks they complete, to help integrate sustainability into their daily routine.</p>
                <p>Through <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bottom of My Garden</span>, I design an intimate user experience where sustainability feels attainable. Users are guided through the app by illustrations and animations to feed their garden with task completion, such as carpooling or taking a shower in less than five minutes. Over time, the garden quantifies the user's personal efforts without comparing their impact to a global degree of change. Users experience design that is meant to encourage. By the aid of these visuals, users can better digest lengthy, overwhelming realities into smaller, more helpful and hopeful possibilities.</p>

                        <p>To view your dashboard of sustainable tasks, you tap "my tasks" from the homescreen. In the tasks dashboard, you will find potted plants of your current week's progress keeping up with each task. The more developed the plant, the more often you've been keeping up with that task.</p>

                    <h2 id="method">Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The ideas behind my thesis came from a few places. I have a history in the sciences, an interest in environmental justice, and a passion for cutting-edge technology. I started breaking down the components of these sectors of my brain, and came up with my Methodology Ant Farm. The cascade of ant farm anatomy helped me visualize the paths that cross between seemingly unrelated concepts. I even feature ants to represent my train of thought passing through and populating certain ideas.</p>
                    <p>My methodology map eventually led me to consider my specific beliefs as a designer. <span style="font-style:italic;">What is graphic design to me? What is graphic design to others?</span> In studio lecture, my professor provided us with a brainstorming map that particularly caught my attention.</p>

                <div id="methodology-2-text">
                    <p>This triangular diagram led me to ask myself how exactly graphic design is helping me deliver my thesis. I use graphic design as a tool. I use graphic design as if it is a machine, helping me translate complicated ideas into comprehensible visuals. I took this further into my process and investigated specifi c questions I was interested in related to communication. <span style="font-style:italic;">What am I communicating?</span> As a graphic designer, someone who understands the design machinery, <span style="font-style:italic;">how can I provide guidance?</span></p>

                    <p>After my experience with NASA Psyche Inspired and BU Spark!, I was able to develop the concept of futurism to closer align my thesis project with my career interests. Both of those previous experiences of mine concern how design affects communication to the viewer. In my notes, I wrote “future + tasks + illustrate”. That was the point where I finally evolved my brainstorming into the concept of a personal garden app to track a user's sustainability tasks.</p>

                    <p>After a series of specific questions, I was then much more aware of what exactly I was doing. My vision was to generate an app to help the user grasp sustainability on a smaller, more local scale. I knew I wanted to work with “the future” in some capacity, and helping people improve how they live in the future was how I could get there. I wanted people to envision their future of sustainability.</p>
