                <p>As global warming and other planetary catastrophes are worsening, tension forms between the ecosystem and the future—<span style="font-style:italic;">when will Earth be healthy again? How do we get there faster?</span> When the media force-feeds us the doom of the biosphere on a global scale, it can be difficult for an individual to appreciate the sustainable progress we have made thus far. The Climate Clock, for example, is designed to instill fear, in that we are running out of time to turn things around. It is here where I observe how design influences our perception of the future; <span style="font-style:italic;">what role can design play instead to show our progress? How can design influence our perception of “doing enough”?</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-style:italic;">The Bottom of My Garden</span> is the concept for an app designed to ease this tension by focusing on you. This experience displays the sustainable progress of an individual through the metaphor of a garden. While Earth's ecosystem is vast and difficult to quantify, a garden is small and local, benefiting solely from its caretaker. Users create their own personal ecosystem, thriving on the tasks they complete, to help integrate sustainability into their daily routine.</p>
                <p>Through <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bottom of My Garden</span>, I design an intimate user experience where sustainability feels attainable. Users are guided through the app by illustrations and animations to feed their garden with task completion, such as carpooling or taking a shower in less than five minutes. Over time, the garden quantifies the user's personal efforts without comparing their impact to a global degree of change. Users experience design that is meant to encourage. By the aid of these visuals, users can better digest lengthy, overwhelming realities into smaller, more helpful and hopeful possibilities.</p>

                    <p>The ideas behind my thesis came from a few places. I have a history in the sciences, an interest in environmental justice, and a passion for cutting-edge technology. I started breaking down the components of these sectors of my brain, and came up with my Methodology Ant Farm. The cascade of ant farm anatomy helped me visualize the paths that cross between seemingly unrelated concepts. I even feature ants to represent my train of thought passing through and populating certain ideas.</p>
                    <p>My methodology map eventually led me to consider my specific beliefs as a designer. <span style="font-style:italic;">What is graphic design to me? What is graphic design to others?</span> In studio lecture, my professor provided us with a brainstorming map that particularly caught my attention.</p>

                    <p>This triangular diagram led me to ask myself how exactly graphic design is helping me deliver my thesis. I use graphic design as a tool. I use graphic design as if it is a machine, helping me translate complicated ideas into comprehensible visuals. I took this further into my process and investigated specific questions I was interested in related to communication. <span style="font-style:italic;">What am I communicating?</span> As a graphic designer, someone who understands the design machinery, <span style="font-style:italic;">how can I provide guidance?</span></p>

                    <p>After my experience with NASA Psyche Inspired and BU Spark!, I was able to develop the concept of futurism to closer align my thesis project with my career interests. Both of those previous experiences of mine concern how design affects communication to the viewer. In my notes, I wrote “future + tasks + illustrate”. That was the point where I finally evolved my brainstorming into the concept of a personal garden app to track a user's sustainability tasks.</p>

                    <p>So, what's the problem? I often found the usual perspective of sustainability that people consume is that it is our last resort to save the planet. That perspective is not entirely wrong, however it installs this sense of fear in the viewer as they try to transition their lifestyle before time runs out to turn things around. In my thesis statement, I mentioned the <a href="https://climateclock.world/" style="font-weight:bold;color:rgb(68, 0, 255);">Climate Clock</a>, which is basically a clock counting down the time we have left before global warming is irreversible. It features a giant clock with black text on a red background, accompanied by an interactive graph for the user to see how our investment in sustainability and speed of activating it can buy us more time. This only makes the goal seem further away as it becomes a pipedream.</p>

            <div id="my-hypothesis">
                    <h2 id="hypo">My Hypothesis</h2>
                    <p>My plan was to completely flip the Climate Clock narrative and find a way to localize the impacts that people are making on the daily. Instead of worrying people about how effective the transition process should be, I could encourage the transition by highlighting significant changes on a personal level. With this methodology, I could assist users in ignoring comparisons of their impact to a global degree of change, and instead focus on how much they are doing to better their life in the now.</p>

                <p>While I had my ideas in place, I then faced the ultimate design question: <span style="font-style:italic;">what is this going to look like? How do I visualize this?</span> My train of thought started looking for inspirations, and I began with looking at ways I could pictorially define what “future” might look or feel like.</p>
                <p>I looked at a lot of artwork ranging from Walt Disney's Tomorrowland Concepts, to 1940s Work Projects Administration (WPA) tourism posters, to my own projects.</p>
                <p>From Walt Disney's posters, I enjoyed how they generated optimistic visions of advancing technology. From the 1940s WPA tourism posters, I was interested in how they help viewers picture what it might be like to visit the locations solely through the use of concept design. From my own past artwork, I was looking for how to form context around my identity as a graphic designer.</p>

                    <p>As part of our thesis process, we were recommended to interview someone in the design industry with skills related to our theses. For my senior thesis interview, I chose to introduce my project ideas to Patrick Smith, Creative Director and Animator of his game portfolio titled <a href="https://vectorpark.itch.io/" target="_blank" style="font-weight:bold;color:rgb(68, 0, 255);">Vectorpark</a>. I chose to interview Patrick Smith because I felt as though he could help me develop ideas for the animated, storytelling components of my app idea. I also have admired his work since I was a child, and I was interested in hearing about what graphic design/web design was like during the 90s and 2000s.</p>

                <p>While wanting to design an immersive world for the user to enjoy returning to, I was also looking for ways to display information about specific tasks (plants) and their progress growing. Simultaniously, I didn't want the dashboard to feel too plant-oriented because I wanted the app to suggest some degree of exploration (similar to what Patrick Smith told me about Vectorpark) and freedom from any rigid genre of app. I was thinking of designing a curious and uplifting space for users to enjoy tracking their efforts. Since this would be a time-based narrative for the user's data to be contextualized into, I figured pulling individual frames of my animations would help show a plant's growth in-progress. For example, showing a plant growing only halfway to completion and communicating to the user their efforts. As much as I need to reward the user, I also need to give them an incentive to come back.</p>
