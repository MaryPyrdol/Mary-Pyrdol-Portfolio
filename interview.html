                <h2>Interview with Patrick Smith</h2>
                <p>At the start of our zoom call, I first learned that Patrick started his career path by sharing his weird experimentation with the internet world. His first games (which included my favorite, Feed the Head), were purely experimental, for which he thought “why not just put them on the internet?” For Patrick, the 2000s internet was a very ambiguous place where people would just click on random links. So he shared the link of his game with people, and they shared it with others, and then Patrick noticed a lot of people found interest in his portfolio of interactive, dialogue-lacking games. So he released a lot of his other projects, and then soon turned them into IOS/Android apps. From this, I was able to connect with how he develops narrative without words in animation.</p>

            <div id="questions">
                <p>I asked him the following questions:</p>
                <h3>What is your creative process?</h3>
                <h3>Why Vectorpark? (Why do you make art?)</h3>
                <h3>How do you go about storytelling with design?</h3>
            </div>
            <div id="question-1">
                <div id="Q1-text">
                    <p>To my first question, Patrick described how he enjoyed the silence of comics, specifically silent narrative comics. I immediately thought of Gary Larson's <a href="https://www.thefarside.com/" target="_blank" style="font-weight:bold;color:rgb(68, 0, 255);">The Far Side</a> comics, which use only illustrations (and rarely background text) to describe the scene. Patrick described that he enjoyed how silent narratives allow viewers to wander and explore the “space” (in this case, explore the space of the page). Stories can be stitched together by visual descriptors that give components context between one another. He sees this as an organic process, where you don't sit down to write a story—the illustration writes it for you.</p>

                    <p>The designs and concepts for these posters were inspired by the Work Project Administration (WPA) posters and also the <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/galleries/visions-of-the-future" style="font-weight:bold;color:rgb(68, 0, 255);" target="_blank">Visions of the Future</a> collection done by The Studio at NASA JPL. Similarly to Disney's Tomorrowland posters, Visions of the Future posters help viewers picture what it may look or feel like to potentially visit these places in the future. Concept designs like those posters helped me figure out where my passions lie in terms of generating communicative graphic design.</p>
